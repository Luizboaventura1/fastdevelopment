   cd fastdevelopment
   npm install
   npm run dev

3. **Create your firebase project**
  - put the environment variables in the `.env.template` example.

4. **Firebase configuration**
  - Create a "users" document in Firebase and then create the Google login option in Firebase Authentication

### .env.template

```
# Create a project in firebase and put your keys here
API_KEY=
AUTH_DOMAIN=
PROJECT_ID=
STORAGE_BUCKET=
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
APP_ID=
MEASUREMENT_ID=

# Make your own key, example: g3f3-3r5g-3fwd-3fwc

Then just create a document called `users` in firestore and you will be able to use the application and contribute.
